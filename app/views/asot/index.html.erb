<h1>Best ASOT ever?</h1>
<div id='intro'>
<p>So, which is the best <a href='http://www.arminvanbuuren.com/asot/' target='_blank'>
A State of Trance</a> Episode, after all? Frankly, I don't know either.</p>

<p>But to help you decide which is the best, I have compiled this list of ASOT episodes from recent years. 
The number of <strong>simply amazing! votes</strong> from the <a href="http://di.fm" target='_blank'>Digitally Imported</a> forum posts is listed for each ASOT episode as a popularity indicator.
</p>

<p>
What? Only the simply amazing votes from <a href="http://di.fm" target='_blank'>di.fm</a>? Is this accurate? I think it's good enough.
</p>

<p>Because each week a bunch of people listen to ASOT via <a href="http://di.fm" target='_blank'>di.fm</a> and then cast their vote on the di.fm forum. So this database should at the least give a hint at what might be the <i>Best ASOT ever</i>.
</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
